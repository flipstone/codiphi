Codiphi protocol
---
Define your own wargame codex (or use someone else's) in human-readable file structure
Declare your army list as a simple json construct
Codiphi will complete, validate and price your list

Basic Instructions
---
1. Find or write your codiphile
Setup a codiphi schematic file (a '_codiphile_').  We've tried to make this a very natural structure that's easy to read and manage.  Here's a simple example:

    model :hero {
      cost 100
    }
    list { 
      cost_measure "points"
      expects 1 :hero
    }

This codiphile declares:
  "A named :hero that costs 100 units"
  "Any list created under this schematic is priced in points."
  "Any list created under this schematic requires one :hero model."

You can also ask a friend for theirs.

2. Build out your list
Write a JSON-formatted file that makes selections for your army.  Every list file must include a "list" root node that contains a "schematic" attribute.  Here's an example list:

  {
      "list":
      {
          "description": "First Man Standing",
          "schematic": "test/hero1",
          "author":"Codiphi Developer",
          "author_email":"development@flipstone.com",
          "variant": "legal",
          "version": "1",
          "model":{
              "type":"hero",
              "description":"Neo",
              "count":1
          }
      }
  }

3. Run codiphi on your list

codiphi my_list_file.json

This will generate a similar json to the one created, but decorated with either attributes from the codiphile or with validation errors describing why the list is not legal under the schematic.

think rubygems.org for codiphi: People can share and trade Codex implementations- maybe fork, but importantly, reference public schematics in list jsons.
